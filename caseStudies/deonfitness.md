## Cloud-based, centralized service discovery for greater efficiency

**After briefly **evaluating** both open source and paid service discovery tools, MBRDNA chose HashiCorp Consul Enterprise as their Service Discovery mechanism in their effort to migrate to Azure.**

1. With the initial architecture in place, Govindarajan's team focused its attention on their critical work: optimizing its code development operations.

1. Unlike the other on-premises and open source service discovery tools MBRDNA evaluated, cloud native Consul features dynamic application and infrastructure service location and easy connection across any runtime platform or cloud. The centralized services registry, automated centralized network middleware configuration, and real-time directory of all running services combine to dramatically improve application inventory management and faster service connectivity.

*For example, MBRDNA developers can now request an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster through a self-service portal and have everything they need for their deployment — code, scripts, APIs, and Consul clients — in less than 30 minutes. Once their services have been deployed, other teams can simply use code or scripts on their clusters to look up the services or the Consul client they need and connect them instantly.*

> "Consul lets us spread more than 200 microservices over several AKS clusters," Govindarajan explains. "Each AKS cluster connects to a local Consul client, which feeds into a Consul cluster that forms a larger service discovery mesh that allows us to find and connect services in a matter of minutes with minimal effort."
